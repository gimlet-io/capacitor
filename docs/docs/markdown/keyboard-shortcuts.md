## Keyboard Shortcuts

Every action and navigation is available from the keyboard.

- Common actions like Describe (d), Yaml (y), Events (e) and Delete (ctrl+d) are available for all resource types
- Per resource type actions are also available. These contextual shortcuts are displayed on the screen when a resource type is selected. Eg.: ctrl+s for scaling deployments.
