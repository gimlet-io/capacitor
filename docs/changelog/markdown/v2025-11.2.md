## Metrics

You get an overview of pod CPU and memory usage on the podlist
- with warnings if you are close to the defined limits,
- or if you are using more resources than you state in your resource requests.

In the resource drawer, you can track resource usage over time.

## Configurable default views (in the self-hosted version)

It was a reoccuring ask to specify the default views for end-users. In the self-hosted version, you can use the `SYSTEM_VIEWS` environment variable to provide its JSON.

The Helm chart also allows configuration:

```yaml
# Optional: configure default system views shown in the UI
# Multi-line JSON example using a literal block scalar
systemViews: |
  [
    {
      "id": "pods",
      "label": "Pods",
      "filters": [
        { "name": "ResourceType", "value": "core/Pod" },
        { "name": "Namespace", "value": "flux-system" }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

## `kluctl` support

[kluctl](https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl) is a tool that allows for more controlled deployments than `kubectl`, and it also exists in a controller form. It is the brainchild of Alexander Block and it can be an alternative to FluxCD.

Capacitor Next's UI patterns allow for quick integrations for many Kubernetes native tools:
- The ResourceList can have pre-defined columns, including functions that extract resource statuse,
- and it also has a DetailRowRenderer so we can display additional context inside the ResourceList.
- The detail view provides a full page for, well.. details. And existing patterns that we used for classic Helm, HelmReleases and Kustomizations can be adapted for tools like kluctl.

Currently,
- we support the KluctlDeployment custom resource that defines kluctl's controller based deploys 
- and we also support kluctl CLI type deploys as kluctl maintains the metadata on the cluster as secrets. For these, we introduced a pseudo resource type: Deployment.

The row renderers:

The two resource tpes share the same detail view:

With command history:
