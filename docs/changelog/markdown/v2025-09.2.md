## Major Performance Improvement

`kubectl` is fast returning tables, but it does not allow advanced filtering or streaming updates.

Capacitor Next was using streaming updates and the complete Kubernetes resource to render and peform filters. This made loading continuous, but often unclear whether the loading has finished. The response size often made the loading slow too.

In this version, Capacitor Next combines the table based API responses - the one that powers `kubectl` -  with complete, streamed resource JSON. The table response is shown first, and enhanced by the full resource to perform advanced renders and filters.

With a loader that indicates the loading state.

## Agent for Multi-Cluster

The self-hosted version did multi-cluster so far by reaching out to the API server of remote kubernetes clusters. This posed two problems: firewalls, and token management to grant API access to Capacitor Next.

In this version, we are introducing an agent component that runs in the remote kubernetes cluster, and connects to the Capacitor Next instance. This is essentially a proxy for the API server. The good thing about it is that it uses service account tokens that are rotated by kubernetes. Leaving no token management task.

## New Versioning

From this version we are switching to calendar based version numbers with a bi-weekly feature release cadence.

- `v2025-09.1` is the first feature release in September 2025. Landing mid month.
- `v2025-09.2` is the second feature release in September 2025. Landing at the end of the month, or perhaps the beginning of the next one.
- `v2025-09.1-patch1` is the first patch release of the first feature release in September 2025.
- `v2025-09.2-rc2` is the second release candidate of the second feature release in September 2025.
- `v2025-09.2-debug1` is a debug release of the second feature release in September 2025. Meant to be installed only by request of the maintainers.

The update notifications in the UI trigger only on feature releases: `v2025-09.1`, `v2025-09.2`.

You may install `patch` and `rc` releases if you please, `debug` releases if requested.

You can install a specific version by supplying the version tag:

```
wget -qO- https://gimlet.io/install-capacitor | bash -s -- v2025-09.2
```
