@src/components/filterBar/FilterBar.tsx
@src/store/filterStore.tsx
@public/styles/main.css

We are able to set different filters in the filter bar.
- We should maintain the history of previous filters and I would like to go back and forth between previous filters.
- A left and right arrow button in the filterbar should manage this, this button group should stick to the right edge of the bar
- A keyboard shortcut should be associated to these buttons: ctrl+left arrow and ctrl+right arrow. Don't forget to use the common visual representation of the shortcuts.
