# Task

Add a new tab to @src/components/resourceDetail/ResourceDrawer.tsx call it "Exec". It is only available for pods, on ctrl+e command shortcut.

When the tab is active, you should start an interactive shell session in it, like one would do with `kubectl exec -it <podname>`. Try starting sh, ash or bash if available. The tab should show a terminal emulator in the browser.
