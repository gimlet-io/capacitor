# Capacitor

A general purpose UI for FluxCD.

## Why

FluxCD is an amazing backend for all things gitops.

It is a shame that ArgoCD gained so much traction mostly because developers appreciate the UI. Rolling out a read-only ArgoCD UI made Argo the de-facto kubernetes dashboard, where people look at logs and various kubernetes resources.

Capacitor's goal is to level the field: providing a UI option for Flux users that matches or exceeds the level of ArgoCD.

## Philosophy

Capacitor wants to be more than a tool that displays Flux's CRDs in tables. Capacitor wants to provide contextualized information for developers to best operate their applications.

## Roadmap

  - Flux CRD data ("sync state") backend
  - Flux CRD data ("sync state") frontend
  - UI for kubernetes resources deployed by Flux
  - Quick actions: logs, events, describe, port-forward
  - Displaying Errors
  - Error notifications
  - Support for environments
  - Display application meta information - service catalog items
