# Capacitor

A general purpose UI for FluxCD.

## Installation

### Kubernetes maninfests

```
kubectl create namespace infrastructure

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimlet-io/capacitor/main/deploy/k8s/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimlet-io/capacitor/main/deploy/k8s/manifest.yaml

kubectl port-forward svc/capacitor -n infrastructure 9000:9000
```

### Helm

```
kubectl create namespace infrastructure

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimlet-io/capacitor/main/deploy/k8s/rbac.yaml

helm repo add onechart https://chart.onechart.dev

helm upgrade -i capacitor -n infrastructure onechart/onechart -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimlet-io/capacitor/main/deploy/helm/onechart-helm-values.yaml

kubectl port-forward svc/capacitor -n infrastructure 9000:9000
```


## Why

FluxCD is an amazing backend for all things gitops.

It is a shame that ArgoCD gained so much traction mostly because developers appreciate the UI. Rolling out a read-only ArgoCD UI made Argo the de-facto kubernetes dashboard, where people look at logs and various kubernetes resources.

Capacitor's goal is to level the field: providing a UI option for Flux users that matches or exceeds the level of ArgoCD.

## Philosophy

Capacitor wants to be more than a tool that displays Flux's CRDs in tables. Capacitor wants to provide contextualized information for developers to best operate their applications.

## Roadmap

  - DONE: Flux CRD data ("sync state") backend
  - DONE: Flux CRD data ("sync state") frontend
  - DONE: UI for kubernetes resources deployed by Flux
  - DONE: Quick actions: logs, events, describe, port-forward
  - Displaying Errors
  - Error notifications
  - Support for environments
  - Display application meta information - service catalog items
